# SHARK
<u>**S**tructural **H**ealth **A**ssessment and **R**eal-time **K**inematics</u> observer (SHARK) is a real-time state estimation platform for fixed-bottom and floating wind turbines. Using a [semi-linear dynamics model](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vwhkfsmnwypk#2b01ba), SHARK computes a real-time state estimate using either an Extended Kalman filter or Square-Root Unscented Kalman filter (CITE).
