 observer (SHARK) for floating wind turbine systems.

SHARK intends to use an extended Kalman filter (EKF) or square-root Kalman filter (SRKF) to provide real-time state estimates for unmeasurable floating wind turbine states. These states can be used for full-state feedback control or in conjuction with AI tools to further predict system responses, condition, and structural loads.
